      <p>January 10, 2014 was the day I started my transition. I told myself I was going to tell as many people as possible. Dig myself a hole so deep that this time, I can’t get out. Kind of not the best analogy, but it made a ton of sense at the time.</p>
      <p>I’ve never been happier and I’ve never been more myself. Transitioning was the single best decision I have ever made in my entire life.</p>

      <p>Hey kid! I'll keep this short.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The goal is to have fun. Not having fun? Do something else.</li>
        <li>You had a conversation with MJ in the front seat of Mommy and Daddy's Isuzu Rodeo during Trunk-or-Treat at church where you two talked about wanting to be girls. There's more to that than you realize. Anything is possible. Follow your heart.</li>
        <li>You can do whatever it takes to make your life more worth living. Just don't be mean.</li>
        <li>One day you'll get to make your own safety and it'll be better than any safety you ever sought from those around you.</li>
        <li>Your parents' anger isn't your fault. It also isn't your problem -- it's very much theirs.</li>
        <li>Those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.</li>
        <li>I know how you feel about being so powerless about everything -- one day, along with that safety I mentioned, you'll have that power.</li>
        <li>Computers are rad as hell.</li>
        <li>Don't let anyone dull your gorgeous, signature sparkle.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I love you. I've never been angry with you. Go have fun.<br />Your future self</p>

      <h2>2007 - 2013</h2>
      <h2 class="cw">Content warning: Graphic references to self-harm</h2>
      <p>Dearest Alex,</p>
      <p>Tonight is another Christmas Eve. What used to be your favorite day of the year is now a day full of haunting reminders.</p>
      <p>When you went to Christmas Eve church service, you saw all the women dressed in their Christmas best. But the worst sight is all the little girls decked out in their green and red velvet dresses with the plaid bows and shiny Mary Jane flats. I know the ache you have when you see them. I know the agony you feel in your core as you think about the childhood you want but don't get to have.</p>
      <p>Tonight you sit in your bedroom and sob quietly so no one hears. You use the Xacto blade you've hidden between the pages of Steve Wozniak's autobiography to slice the layers of skin on your thighs. The goal of feeling something different or feeling something at all takes up your mind. To be distracted from your life with a different sensation. And to punish yourself for not being who you want to be. And to hurt one of the parts of your body you hate the most.</p>
      <p>One day you'll look at those scars and see something very different. When you look at the scars and you'll remember the quiet sobbing on Christmas eve, and the time when you bled all over Grampa's bathroom rug when you cut the deepest you'd ever cut, and when you got out the blade you kept in your school planner and destroyed your favorite pair of pants in the upstairs bathroom in building 2 at school -- but now you feel a surge of resiliance. Because you fucking made it. You survived and the scars are just a written memior of your journey.</p>
      <p>If you had chosen to end your life, I wouldn't have blamed you. It was impossible to feel anything other than what you felt in those years of your life trying to live as someone who you weren't. The voice of that one sweet woman in the church chior who called you "Bill" after Bill Gates. So scared that you'd disappoint her and everyone else by not being the powerful tech CEO businessMAN everyone saw in you. It's okay, sweet angel. You aren't someone else's dreams. You have your own dreams and there's nothing wrong with that. Your dreams are so much better and those who matter don't mind, and those who mind... they don't matter one little bit.</p>
      <p>For now, crawl into bed and bleed. Let the red of your blood become the red dress you want to be adorned in tonight on Christmas eve. Dream of the day you wear that red dress to church because I'm here to tell you it happens. Every year. In the family photos you beam brighter than the star in the Christmas stories because you won.</p>
      <p>In the coming years, you will find the strength to stop being what people expect you to be and you'll get to thrive and live as who you want to be. Rest assured those who care will stay and love along with you and so many more people will board for the journeys ahead.</p>
      <p>I love you and I see you and I'm not mad at you for a single thing.</p>
      <p>Nothing but love,<br />Hannah</p>

      <p>My lovely lil Hannah,</p>
      <p>Maria Callas is so beauiful isn't she? Her voice is different and her beauty memorable like her tragic story.</p>
      <p>Right now, your life is in Tumblr. It's inside a glowing box placed squarely upon your glass desk in your IKEA catalogue-ready room. That's okay. One day your life of being trapped in that bedroom, inside a dull box, dutifully preforming dull little boyhood when you could have been doing so much more will come to an end and you'll be set free. You'll get to live life inside your dreams. Imagine the possibilities.</p>
      <p>Remember when you came out and Mya' asked if you were going to start wearing heels to school? Remember how amazing that made you feel? The validation, the acceptance? Well you're going to get that not just from her, but from nearly everyone around you. The fear you feel is real and it's so, so valid. But I promise you sweet girl, it's not going to be as bad as you think it will be.</p>
      <p>The high heels you wear will echo through the halls of academia, the dresses you sport will flow with the breeze, the red lipstick that adorns your lips will inspire another generation of trans girls, and the Ray-Ban sunglasses you wear to get coffee will make you look like a movie star.</p>
      <p>One of the things that rampages through you head is the thought that no trans woman will be taken seriously in a boardroom as CEO or in the office as the officianato or subject matter expert. Don't worry, you're wrong. Martine Rothblatt. Jennifer Pritzker.</p>
      <p>Your voice is different, but that's okay. Deep voices are enchanting and sexy. Your beauty is memorable, but you're not a tragic story. You're a novel full of success and survival, trills and thriving.</p>
      <p>There's so much love in my heart for you. You are the foundation of dreams only beginning. I'm so deeply proud of you.</p>
      <p>I love you,<br />Hannah</p>

      <h2>Posted to Tumblr on Sunday January 12th, 2014 at 6:11 PM</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Okay so like here’s a big cool thing you don’t have to read but I guess it’s kinda exciting? Okay that’s all… here goes nothing…</p>
        <p>Okay so like I guess here it is. I’m trans. And I’ve known for a really hella long time. I came out once in like, 10th grade. I told Tumblr, I told my friends, I even told my parents. But then I got really scared and every time I tried to do anything about it, something else got in the way. Be that mental illness, people, or just general fear. But now I finally think I’ve found the courage to become someone I don’t loath, ya know? Someone I want to wake up to, and someone I want to see in the mirror. I really want to love myself. And the fear is pretty much gone. Which I think means I have nothing left to lose. Which is okay, because I’m hoping by doing this, I’ll have something worth fighting for, ya know? I’m afraid this energy is just temporary (hah that’s a whole other story) but it’s okay because even if the energy itself is temporary, I hope it will push me deep enough into the water to make me do something about it. So I’m going to finally start transitioning. I don’t know how to even begin but I’m just gonna wing it and delve into the deep underworld of queer.</p>
        <p>And like, I don’t think I’m 100% transgirl, either. I guess I’m a weird mix of .5% homosexual boy, 5.5% androgynous non-binary human being, and 94% girl. But I’m super okay with that and I’m proud of my queer gender.</p>
        <p>So I came out to a few of my really good friends Friday, I’m going to come out to my doctors Monday and Tuesday, and my good friend here at school, and I’m going to come out at Q&A (because I want it to be real on like, a big scale, ya know?) and yes. And here I am coming out to Tumblr once again. Hopefully this time it’s for real. Hopefully I have the fight in me.</p>
        <p>So I’m going to grow my hair out and dye it and wear high heels and contour like a bad ass and be happy with my life and I’m so excited omg like I haven’t stopped smiling in days because I am so excited to be who I really want to be. Even if it’s going to be hard, it will be so worth it in the end. So fuck society’s bullshit norms I’m going to let it go, and be free, and be the queer woman I’ve always wanted to be.</p>
        <p>Okay thank you for listening to this queer little rant. And please enjoy your day~ <3</p>
